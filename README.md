# caddy-waf feeds

This repository contains a workflow to daily update and release IP blacklist, DNS blacklist and OWASP rules for the [caddy-waf](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf) project. This is useful to avoid the hassle to mantain lists for caddy-waf users.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still under development since there are critical bugs still to fix. Once fixed you can expect the first tagged release :)
